                SoundScapes was a sound visualization experiment which allowed us to combine our design skill with our artistic sense of uninhibited exploration, which was all tempered by User Experience (UX) research techniques. We were inspired by Buddhism, biocentrism, and indie rock to create an experence based on an infinite feedback loop of the user's input and the program's output.

                Version I, completed in Winter 2016, was built to visualize voice and ambient noise in Google Chrome. To add to our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, knowledge, we designed exercises for ourselves in relevant JavaScript libraries.

            <p>
                First, I learned to grab microphone input through the browser with Web Audio API, which I visualized as a waveform. Next, Michelle learned to render 3D objects (which we called our “Cheerios”) in the browser using Three.js. Finally, we combined our exercises to create cubes (our “Jello”), which would bounce to the amplitude of the user's voice.

            <h2>User Testing</h2>

                We combined our new-found JavaScript skills into a prototype, which we tested with a variety of possible users. The fact that our process was influenced by both art and design was reflected in user's responses. Some users said they enjoyed the visuals for their own sake, like a campfire. Some user speculated on possible uses for such a visualization - including visualizing political speeches to glean data on a speaker's intonation.
